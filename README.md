# 4_BIT_ALU_ASIC_DESIGN_FLOW
A complete RTL-to-GDSII ASIC design flow using open-source tools and the SkyWater SKY130 PDK on Ubuntu 22.04.5. The design is a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), implemented and verified by end-to-end flow. Design authored around a structural 4‑bit ALU and verified through simulation, synthesis, placement/routing, and physical verification checks.
